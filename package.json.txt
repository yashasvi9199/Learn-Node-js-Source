To initialize package.json
- npm init -y (create a default package.json file)
- npm init (it will run and ask for all the details to be edited.)

In case package.json is lost/deleted
- initialize again and manually install all the packages.
- easier for small APIs but impossible for big projects

In case node-module folder is deleted
- npm i     //or
- npm install

package-lock.json
- fixes the dependencies related onjects/modules
- prevents node modules (aka packages) from updgrading unnecessarily due to other package dependency
- contains url and integrity (hash code checksum) for all node modules (aka packages)
- if deleted : npm i
